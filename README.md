# Argo CD MCP Server

An implementation of [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), enabling AI assistants to interact with your Argo CD applications through natural language. This server allows for seamless integration with Visual Studio Code and other MCP clients through stdio and HTTP stream transport protocols.

## Features

- **Transport Protocols**: Supports both stdio and HTTP stream transport modes for flexible integration with different clients
- **Complete Argo CD API Integration**: Provides comprehensive access to Argo CD resources and operations
- **AI Assistant Ready**: Pre-configured tools for AI assistants to interact with Argo CD in natural language

## Available Tools

The server provides the following ArgoCD management tools:

### Application Management
- `list_applications`: List and filter all applications
- `get_application`: Get detailed information about a specific application
- `create_application`: Create a new application
- `update_application`: Update an existing application
- `delete_application`: Delete an application
- `sync_application`: Trigger a sync operation on an application

### Resource Management
- `get_application_resource_tree`: Get the resource tree for a specific application
- `get_application_managed_resources`: Get managed resources for a specific application
- `get_application_workload_logs`: Get logs for application workloads (Pods, Deployments, etc.)
- `get_resource_events`: Get events for resources managed by an application
- `get_resource_actions`: Get available actions for resources
- `run_resource_action`: Run an action on a resource

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- pnpm package manager (for development)
- Argo CD instance with API access
- Argo CD API token (see the [docs for instructions](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developer-guide/api-docs/#authorization)) 

### Usage with Cursor
1. Follow the [Cursor documentation for MCP support](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol), and create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "argocd-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "argocd-mcp@latest",
        "stdio"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ARGOCD_BASE_URL": "<argocd_url>",
        "ARGOCD_API_TOKEN": "<argocd_token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Start a conversation with Agent mode to use the MCP.

### Usage with VSCode

1. Follow the [Use MCP servers in VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers), and create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your project:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "argocd-mcp-stdio": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "argocd-mcp@latest",
        "stdio"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ARGOCD_BASE_URL": "<argocd_url>",
        "ARGOCD_API_TOKEN": "<argocd_token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Start a conversation with an AI assistant in VS Code that supports MCP.

### Usage with Claude Desktop

1. Follow the [MCP in Claude Desktop documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user), and create a `claude_desktop_config.json` configuration file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "argocd-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "argocd-mcp@latest",
        "stdio"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ARGOCD_BASE_URL": "<argocd_url>",
        "ARGOCD_API_TOKEN": "<argocd_token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Configure Claude Desktop to use this configuration file in settings.

### Self-signed Certificates

If your Argo CD instance uses self-signed certificates or certificates from a private Certificate Authority (CA), you may need to add the following environment variable to your configuration:

```
"NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0"
```

This disables TLS certificate validation for Node.js when connecting to Argo CD instances using self-signed certificates or certificates from private CAs that aren't trusted by your system's certificate store.

> **Warning**: Disabling SSL verification reduces security. Use this setting only in development environments or when you understand the security implications.


### Read Only Mode

MCP Server will as default run in a ReadOnly mode to avoid resource or application modification, you should set the environment variable to false to enable everything:
```
"MCP_READ_ONLY": "false"
```
This will enable the following tools:
- `create_application`
- `update_application`
- `delete_application`
- `sync_application`
- `run_resource_action`


## For Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/snothub/mcp-for-argocd.git
cd mcp-for-argocd
```

2. Install project dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server with hot reloading enabled:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
Once the server is running, you can utilize the MCP server within Visual Studio Code or other MCP client.

### Upgrading ArgoCD Types

To update the TypeScript type definitions based on the latest Argo CD API specification:

1. Download the `swagger.json` file from the [ArgoCD release page](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases), for example here is the [swagger.json link](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/v2.14.11/assets/swagger.json) for ArgoCD v2.14.11.

2. Place the downloaded `swagger.json` file in the root directory of the `argocd-mcp` project.

3. Generate the TypeScript types from the Swagger definition by running the following command. This will create or overwrite the `src/types/argocd.d.ts` file:
    ```bash
    pnpm run generate-types
    ```

4. Update the `src/types/argocd-types.ts` file to export the required types from the newly generated `src/types/argocd.d.ts`. This step often requires manual review to ensure only necessary types are exposed.
